- use vars (concat and add)
- boolean true/false on/off, yes/no
- if: return "yes" or "no" depending on argument
- if inside if
- else
- else if
- order in ifs
- if and return early instead of if else if
- === equality, 1===1 , false: 1==="1"
- !==
- &&
- ||
- ">" 5 > 3: true, 5 > "3": true, 2 > 3: false
- ">="
- "<"
- "<="
- == equality, converts value, different from =, 1 == 1, 1 =="1"
- !=
- ! (extra)
- store strings on array
- store strings and numbers on array
- access arrays with []
- modify arrays with []
- append: add item to array on the right with push
- add array inside array
- get and remove item from right with pop
- get and remove item from left with shift (left->shiFtpop<-right)
- prepend: add item to array on the left with unshift (left->unpush<-right)
- nest/sub/multi-dimensional: array inside another array
- access nested arrays with []
- "bla " + var + " ble" (watch spaces)
- string length (number of characters)
- string length not ok when utf8 has len 2?
- [] get first charactes on string
- [] get n character on string
- [] get last character on string
- [] get penultimate character on string
- explain only one value inside var (AFTER ARRAYS)
- function: logs hello world (console.log is also a function)
- pass values to function
- function return value
- function returns undefined (when there is no return defined)
- if: inside function
- assign value to var with return from function
- return boolean from functions (return directly)
- object: like dictionaries that can point to values, arrays, other dics, functions
- object: with dot notation
- object: with brackets (if you have spaces on name)
- object: with brackets (and variables)
- object: updating with dot notation
- object: updating with brackets
- object: add new property dot
- object: add new property brackets
- object: delete property
- object: lookup (like dictionary: a: alpha, b: bravo, ...)
- object: check if it has property with hasOwnProperty https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17150396/benefit-of-using-object-hasownproperty-vs-testing-if-property-is-undefined/29272601
- object: accessing different parts of an object with . or [](nested)
- object: storing objects around (the linkage crap)
- i++
- i--
- while: print something (draw flow)
- while: infinite loop
- while: push to array
- for: push to array (transform a while into a for and draw the flow)
- for: odd numbers (adding 2 by 2)
- for: odd numbers (but check with %)
- for: count backwards
- for: count jumping 2 by 2
- for: go through an array (iterate)
- for inside for
- do ... while (draw flow)
- decimal aka floating point numbers or floats
- rounding errors (not only js)
- decimals work like whole numbers
- divide decimal
- remainder
- x+=2 (commutative)
- x-=3 (commutative)
- x\*=2 (commutative)
- x /= 2 (not commutative)
- += strings
- scope: global (no var)
- scope: window
- scope: funtion parameters
- scope: inside function
- scope: inside if
- scope: inside for
- scope: inside {}
- scope: inside switch
- scope: local in func, global and parameter with the same name
- string immutability
- switch
- switch with default
- switch with several cases doing the same
- comparing to boolean
- array: access nested array [{arr:[]}, ...]

- math.floor
- generate random whole numbers

# _MISC_

- try to initialize variable that doesnt exist (scope)
- a variable is like an address to a container for non-primitive values (arrs, fns, objs).
- variables aren't the values, they are the containers for the values (think a bag contains a rock but the bag is not a rock )
- "Throughout this article, you'll be asked to type in lines of code to test your understanding of the content."

- TIL you can add many empty lines
- add string with number
- number inside a string (think excel formats)
- escape sequences
- strange strings: empty, numbers, console.log
- back quotes and show example with stuff inside ``
- string literal vs string object (after?)
- explain ASI rules?
- show ascii art in console?

- scope: area where a variable is visible
- arguments/parameters: values passed into function (inputs)
- call/invoke: run
- prepend: add to the left or top file
- append: add to the right or end of file
- bracket notation: access stuff to theright with square brackets []
- immutable: value doesnt change after being assigned
- x & y are tightly coupled: x very dependent on y (or y on x)
- concatenate: join text
- sub-array: array inside an array
- sub-anything: x inside x
- nested = inside
- multi-dimensional: normally arrays and inside each other
- iterate = repeat
- increment = add
- decrement = subtract

- no negation operator
