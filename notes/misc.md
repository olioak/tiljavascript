- create courses: start with beginner javascript?
- check what's going on with the title when on a single til?
- maybe instead of the user marking the tils with a checkmark, visited tils could have a checkmark
- have previous/next on individual tils
- have related tils on individual til?

# guidelines
is it important now? later or out of scope?
- html or htm? use just one. not importnat
- which names can a page have? not important, if learner puts something wrong, it will not work
