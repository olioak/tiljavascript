This is the paste bin.

# guidelines

- i took more than 2h to write the "declare variables"... If I was a PS4, you would be listening to my fans in overdrive...
- You can always improve later. It's not the end of the world if a title is not good
- check the use of I/You/We. It's messy
- you need to do -> you do
- try to add "!" and fix const on the basic js curriculum in fcc
- improve mdn? https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Variables#Initializing_a_variable
- see code? or check code?

- story tell it

## Is it important now?

- write camel case?
- html or htm? use just one. not importnat
- which names can a page have? not important, if learner puts something wrong, it will not work

# about

The descriptions are 280 characters long. The code has no limit.
Even if the code has not restriction, because the description is short, the code naturally stays small.

I avoid describing exceptions and just describe the main point. I will put a note to describe the exceptions later.

I cant offer many alternatives or the text becomes long.

# writing

- direct: instead of "by writing" say "you write"

## instead

- common instead of typical
- notice it

from everybody writes:

- In order to → To
- In spite of → Despite
- A number of → Some
- In the event that → If
- The majority of → Most
- Has the opportunity to → Can
- Despite the fact that → Although

## avoid:

- saying to the reader to "check this for more info". Because they will and then they are flooded with new knowledge. The readers are already doing what you ask, so if you tell them to check the link, it's likely they will. Having the references with low focus is good enough.

- normally
- just
- this, that (say the thing)
