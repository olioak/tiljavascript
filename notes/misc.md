#todo

- looks
- check comment "per my last email" no ff
- copying shows "copied" for half a second
- should i have "/til/title" or just "/title"?
- publish "making of website in 2020" on C:\Users\artur\Dropbox\My PC (DESKTOP-7QBUSEU)\Documents\Camtasia Studio
  - do comments on the video instead of keeping the "wing it" audio. 
- filter (by checkbox, categories, rarity)
- work on mobile
- create courses: start with beginner javascript?
- check what's going on with the title when on a single til?
- maybe instead of the user marking the tils with a checkmark, visited tils could have a checkmark
- have previous/next on individual tils
- have related tils on individual til?

# guidelines

is it important now? later or out of scope?

- html or htm? use just one. not importnat
- which names can a page have? not important, if learner puts something wrong, it will not work
