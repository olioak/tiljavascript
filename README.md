# Decision Log

I'm using styled components. The way to apply the theme seems a bit worse than what material-ui is using but having the styled components in the code is nice. 
I need to jump a bit between the main component and the part where the styles are. It's OK, not sure if I prefer it like this or like Tailwind CSS.
