Previously you learned what a variable is. By now you might think of variables as containers where you store things.

So what 's the issue?
The issue is variables have many rules!

So when you become frustrated, remember forgetting the rules is natural.

```js
// Just a reminder, there is no new code below.

var glassOfWater; // I'm a container, like a glass of water.
glassOfWater = "water"; // The text "water" is the content.

console.log(glassOfWater);
```
