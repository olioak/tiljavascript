We can store the result of operations in a variable.
If we store the result of `1+1` in the variable add, the variable will store `2` .

```js
<script>
    var add = 1 + 1;
    console.log(add); // The console shows the number 2
    var mult = 2 * 10;
    console.log(mult); // The console shows the number 20
</script>
```
