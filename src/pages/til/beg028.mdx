Variables in JavaScript can be used as the values they contain.

So you can add and concatenate variables like if they were values.

```js
<script>
  var x = 1;
  var y = 2;
  var total = x + y; // The `+` is used to add numbers
  console.log(total); // Shows 3

  var firstName = "Frank";
  var lastName = "enstein";
  var fullName = firstName + lastName; // The `+` is used to join the text
  console.log(fullName); // Shows Frankenstein
</script>
```
