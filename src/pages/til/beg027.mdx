If you need to swap the values of 2 variables, you must remember that the previous value is lost.

So what do you have to do? Think how would you swap a glass of water with a glass of wine. You need a third glass.

In our case we need a third variable.

```js
<script>
    // The 4 lines below don't work:
    var v1 = 1;
    var v2 = 2;
    v1 = v2; // Now both v1 and v2 have the value 2
    v2 = v1; // There is no change because v2 is the same as v1
    console.log(v1); // Shows 2
    console.log(v2); // Shows 2

    // The lines below work:
    var glass1 = "wine";
    var glass2 = "water";
    var glass3;

    glass3 = glass1; // glass3 has "wine"
    glass1 = glass2; // Now glass1 has "water"
    glass2 = glass3; // glass2 has "wine"
    console.log(glass1); // Shows "water"
    console.log(glass2); // Shows "wine"
</script>
```
