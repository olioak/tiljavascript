Imagine you want to store a text with your home address. In JavaScript you create a variable. 

It's the same to say _"create variables"_ or _"declare variables"_ or _"define variables"_.

You write the word `var` followed by a name of your choice.

```javascript
// Below is the variable named address. We will fill it on the next TIL.
var address;
```
