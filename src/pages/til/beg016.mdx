A variable is a container that stores a single value, like the text "hello".
Variables have many uses. A common use is to avoid repeating the same text over and over again like in the example below.

No need to understand the code below, details are explained later.

```js
var sentence = "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy";

// Show the same sentence 5 times in the console.
console.log(sentence);
console.log(sentence);
console.log(sentence);
console.log(sentence);
console.log(sentence);
```
