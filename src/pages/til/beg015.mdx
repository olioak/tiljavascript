_"Concatenate strings"_ means joining text. So, saying I concatenate the word "snow" with "ball", it means I'm going to join the words and get the string "snowball".

You concatenate with the `+` sign. So `"snow" + "ball"` results in `"snowball"`.

Mixing different types of quotes is OK.


```javascript
console.log("snow" + "ball"); // Shows "snowball" in the console. 
console.log('snow' + 'ball'); // Shows "snowball" in the console. 
console.log('snow' + "ball"); // Shows "snowball" in the console. 
```
