JavaScript is case sensitive. This means that letters are different if their size is different even if they are the same letter.

For instance, the variable `hi` is different from the variable `Hi`.

```js
<script>
    var hi = "hi";
    var Hi = "Hi!!";
    var bye = "Bye Bye";

    console.log(hi); // Shows "hi"
    console.log(Hi); // Shows "Hi!!"
    console.log(bye); // Shows "Bye Bye"
    console.log(Bye); // Shows an error saying Bye is not defined
</script>
```
