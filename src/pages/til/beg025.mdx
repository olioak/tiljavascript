JavaScript is case sensitive. This means that letters are different if their size is different even if they are the same letter.

For instance, the variable `hi` is different from the variable `Hi`.

```js
var hi = "hi";
var Hi = "Hi!!";
var bye = "Bye Bye";

console.log(hi); // Shows "hi"
console.log(Hi); // Shows "Hi!!"
console.log(bye); // Shows "Bye Bye"
console.log(Bye); // Shows an error saying Bye is not defined
```
