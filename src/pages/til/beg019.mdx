Previously we saw how to declare and initialize a variable in 2 lines.
You can do both things in a single line:

```js
<script>
    // Declare and initialize variable in 2 lines:
    var drink1;
    drink1 = "Milkshake";
    console.log(drink1);

    // Declare and initialize variable in 1 line:
    var drink2 = "Orange juice";
    console.log(drink2);
</script>
```
