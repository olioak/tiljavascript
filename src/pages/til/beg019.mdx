# TIL How to declare and initialize a variable in one line

Previously we saw how to declare and initialize a variable in 2 lines.
You can do both things in a single line:

```js
// Declare and initialize variable in 2 lines:
var drink1;
drink1 = "Milkshake";

// Declare and initialize variable in 1 line:
var drink2 = "Orange juice";
console.log(drink1);
console.log(drink2);
```
