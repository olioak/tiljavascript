You can divide two numbers in JavaScript. `10/2` is going to show **5**.

JavaScript seems to work like a calculator, but it's not always the case.

For instance, if you divide 10 by 0 it will result in `Infinity`. Don't worry too much about infinity or now.

```javascript
console.log(10 / 2); // results in 5
console.log(10 / 0); // results in Infinity
```
