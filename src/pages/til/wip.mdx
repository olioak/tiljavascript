If you want to update a JavaScript variable, you do the same thing you did to initialize it (see code).
Notice that variables only store one value, so before the variable is updated, it contains the value value and then it contains the new value.

```js
var message;
message = "Hello";
console.log(message); // Shows "Hello" in the console.
message = "Bye";
console.log(message); // Shows "Bye" in the console.
```

# TIL How to not get frustrated with variables in JavaScript

Previously you learned what a variable is.
By now you might think of variables like a container where you store things.

So what 's the issue?
The issue is variables have many rules!

The rules are simple but you need to get used to them.

```js
var glassOfWater; // I'm a container, like a glass of water.
glassOfWater = "water"; // The text "water" is the content.

console.log(glassOfWater);
```

# TIL JavaScript variables can store many types of data

A variable can contain many things.
It can contain the string "TIL", or the number 10.
It can also contain other things we will talk later: functions, booleans, nulls, etc.

`
``
js
console.log(1); // The console shows the number 1
console.log("1"); // The console shows the string "1" (different color)

````

# TIL JavaScript variables can store the result of operations

We can store the result of operations in a variable.
If we store the result of `1+1` in the variable add, the variable will store `2` .

``` js
var add = 1 + 1;
console.log(add); // The console shows the number 2
var mult = 2 * 10;
console.log(mult); // The console shows the number 20
````

# TIL valid JavaScript variable names

ref: https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-identifiers

Up to now, we have been naming variables with letters from the alphabet and numbers.

The code below shows valid names and the rules associated with each name.
There are more rules, but they are very rare.

```js
// Use lower or upper case letters
var Hello = "hello";

// Use numbers
var hello1 = "Hello1";

// But don't use numbers at the beginning. The next line results in an error
var 1hello = "oh no!";

// Don't use spaces. The next line results in an error
var hello there = "oh no!";

// You can use $, but it's not common
var $money$bling$ = "$money$bling$";

// Use _
var _hello_there_ = "_hello_there_";

// Don't use special words like var (these are reserved words)
// The next line results in an error
var var = "too many vars! oh no!";
```

# TIL JavaScript variables are case sensitive

JavaScript is case sensitive. This means that letters are different if their size is different even if they are the same letter. For instance, the variable `hi` is different from the variable `Hi`.

```js
var hi = "hi";
var Hi = "Hi!!";
var bye = "Bye Bye";

console.log(hi); // Shows "hi"
console.log(Hi); // Shows "Hi!!"
console.log(bye); // Shows "Bye Bye"
console.log(Bye); // Shows an error saying Bye is not defined
```

# TIL How to copy a variable to another variable

Like physical containers, sometimes you need to put the content of a container into another container.

You do this by using the (`=`) as you use for initalization.

The following expression means you copy the value in b and put it into a:
`b = a`.

```js
var sunny = "sunny!";
var rainy = "rainy!";
var weather;

console.log(weather); // Shows undefined.

weather = rainy; // Copy sunny variable into sunny.
console.log(rainy); // Shows "rainy!", rainy didn't change.
console.log(weather); // Shows "rainy!"

weather = sunny; // Copy rainy variable into sunny.
console.log(weather); // Shows "sunny!"
```

# TIL How to swap variables in JavaScript

If you need to swap the values of 2 variables, you must remember that the previous value is lost.

So what do you have to do? Think how would you swap a glass of water with a glass of wine. You need a third glass.

In our case we need a third variable.

```js
// The 4 lines below don't work:
var v1 = 1;
var v2 = 2;
v1 = v2; // Now both v1 and v2 have the value 2
v2 = v1; // There is no change because v2 is the same as v1
console.log(v1); // Shows 2
console.log(v2); // Shows 2

// The lines below work:
var glass1 = "wine";
var glass2 = "water";
var glass3;

glass3 = glass1; // glass3 has "wine"
glass1 = glass2; // Now glass1 has "water"
glass2 = glass3; // glass2 has "wine"
console.log(glass1); // Shows "water"
console.log(glass2); // Shows "wine"
```

#Â TIL How to use variables in JavaScript

Variables in JavaScript can be used as the values they contain.

So you can add and concatenate variables like if they were values.

```js
var x = 1;
var y = 2;
var total = x + y; // The `+` is used to add numbers
console.log(total); // Shows 3

var firstName = "Frank";
var lastName = "enstein";
var fullName = firstName + lastName; // The `+` is used to join the text
console.log(fullName); // Shows Frankenstein
```
