Like physical containers, sometimes you need to put the content of a container into another container.

You do this by using the (`=`) as you use for initalization.

The following expression means you copy the value in b and put it into a:
`b = a`.

```js
var sunny = "sunny!";
var rainy = "rainy!";
var weather;

console.log(weather); // Shows undefined.

weather = rainy; // Copy sunny variable into sunny.
console.log(rainy); // Shows "rainy!", rainy didn't change.
console.log(weather); // Shows "rainy!"

weather = sunny; // Copy rainy variable into sunny.
console.log(weather); // Shows "sunny!"
```
