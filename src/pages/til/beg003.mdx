JavaScript code is a **sequence of instructions executed from top to bottom**.
You put a semicolon `;` at the end of a line to mark the end of an instruction.

Later we will see exceptions to this rule.

```javascript
console.log("I will show this line");
console.log("Then, I will show this line");
```
