  - talk about the semicolon when writing about it
  - talk about repeating code, run code when you press a button or when a timer finishes.

JavaScript code is a **sequence of instructions executed from top to bottom**.
You put a semicolon `;` at the end of a line to mark the end of an instruction.

Later we will see exceptions to this rule.

```javascript
<script>
  console.log("I will show this line");
  console.log("Then, I will show this line");
</script>
```
