A variable can contain many things.

It can contain the string "TIL" or the number 10.

It can also contain other things we will talk about later: functions, booleans, nulls, etc.

```js
console.log(1); // The console shows the number 1
console.log("1"); // The console shows the string "1" (different color)
```
