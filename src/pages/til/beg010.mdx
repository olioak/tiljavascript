title: Should I use single or double quotes in javascript
rarity: common
videoNotes:
  - show what happens if you put double inside souble
  - mention projects usually just have one type of quotes for consistency
  - vscode can force only one type

Sometimes you will see a string that starts and ends with `"` or starts and ends with `'`. Which one should you choose?

It doesn't matter.

There is a difference though: You can put **single quotes** inside **double quote strings** and you can put **double quotes** inside **single quote strings**.

```javascript
console.log('This string can have double quotes "inside" it.');
console.log("This string can have single quotes 'inside' it.");
```
