If you need to put quotes inside a string, you put a backslash `\` before the double or single quote:
- Single quote is `\'`
- Double quote is `\"`

You need to do this because if you don't do it, JavaScript is going to think the string is over before it really is.

```javascript
console.log("JavaScript \"thinks\" with its \'engine\'.");
```
