  - write the log without the comment
  - put the comment and say, now you know why you wrote that line
  - comment out the console

Notes in code are called comments. You use comments to explain why you wrote some code or to disable parts of your code.

When JavaScript tries to run a line and there are two slashes `//`, it will ignore the text to the right of `//`. The ignored lines are comments.

```javascript
// The amount of money I would like to have
// on my bank account.
console.log("1 billion dollars, muahaha!");

console.log("63 dollars"); // How much money I really have.
```
