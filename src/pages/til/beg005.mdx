videoNotes:
  - put 2 semicolons
  - beginners usually should use semicolons but it's rarely a problem if they forget to put it
  - if you use text editors like vscode fix semicolon issues

If you don't put a semicolon `;` at the end of a line, the code will still work. If semicolons are missing, JavaScript inserts semicolons automatically.

Some developers don't use semicolons, but to do that, they need to know special rules to avoid bugs.

```javascript
console.log("I am working and there is no semicolon at the end")
```
