Up to now, we have been naming variables with letters from the alphabet and numbers.

The code below shows valid names and the rules associated with each name.
There are more rules, but they are very rare.

```js
// Use lower or upper case letters
var Hello = "hello";

// Use numbers
var hello1 = "Hello1";

// But don't use numbers at the beginning. The next line results in an error
var 1hello = "oh no!";

// Don't use spaces. The next line results in an error
var hello there = "oh no!";

// You can use $, but it's not common
var $money$bling$ = "$money$bling$";

// Use _
var _hello_there_ = "_hello_there_";

// Don't use special words like var (these are reserved words)
// The next line results in an error
var var = "too many vars! oh no!";
```
