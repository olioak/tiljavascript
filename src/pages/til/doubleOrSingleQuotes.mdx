Sometimes you will see string that start and with `"` or that start and end with `'`. Which one should you choose? 

It doesn't matter.

There is a difference though: You can put **single quotes** inside **double quote strings** and you can put **single quotes** inside **double quote strings**.

```javascript
console.log('This string can have double quotes "inside" it.');
console.log("This string can have single quotes 'inside' it.");
```
