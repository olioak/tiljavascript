After you declare a variable, you can store data in it.

You do this by typing the variable name, followed by (`=`), followed by the value you want to give it. Example: `food = "ice cream"` .

You use the variable by typing the variable name and JavaScript will replace the variable by the value stored inside it.

We call storing data in a variable **initializing a variable**.

```js
<script>
    var food; // We declared the variable food.
    food = "ice cream"; // We initialized (stored) food with text "ice cream"
    console.log(food); // The console shows "ice cream".
</script>
```
