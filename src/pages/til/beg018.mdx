After you declare a variable, you can store data in it.
We call storing data in a variable **initializing a variable**.

You do this by typing the variable name, followed by ( `=` ), followed by the value you want to give it. Example: `food = "ice cream"` .

You use the variable by typing the variable name and JavaScript will replace the variable by the value stored inside it.

```js
var food; // We declared the variable food.
food = "ice cream"; // We initialized food with text "ice cream"
console.log(food); // The console shows "ice cream".
```
