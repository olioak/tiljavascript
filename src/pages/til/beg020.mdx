If you want to change the value of variable in JavaScript, you do the same thing you did to initialize it (see code below).

Notice that variables only store one value, so before the variable is updated, it contains the value value and then it contains the new value.

```js
var message;
message = "Hello"; // Initializing variable message
console.log(message); // Shows "Hello" in the console

message = "Bye"; // Changing variable message
console.log(message); // Shows "Bye" in the console
```
