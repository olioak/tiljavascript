- im going to use only notepad and google chrome on a windows pc.
- open notepad

- save file on desktop and emphasize to put ".html" (dont talk about htm)
- double click to open in chrome
- update file, mention you saved file
- go to browser press the refresh button
- show difference between console and writing on file (use new Date())
- CONGRATS: you just created a webpage with javascript. this is how amazon and google started.

- write the code, avoid copy. the copy button is there for when you come back and are in a hurry

The most common way to run JavaScript is inside a web page. But JavaScript can also be used to build:

- Desktop apps like **Discord**.
- Mobile apps like **Facebook**.
- Games like **Bejeweled**.

- JavaScript is not hard if you understand the basic parts. 
- You will see a LOT of errors. A developer can see thousands of errors every month. The majority of errors are like typos when you are writing a chat message. 
- Dont get discouraged if you see complex code. First, you can do incredible things with simple code. Second, code is like writing. You dont need to be shakespeare to write your shopping list in a postit. 

I remember how confused I was with variables and loops the first time I saw them.
- Its normal to not understand something the first time. But I will repeat the same things A LOT. 

- this course is focused on javascript, so the visual parts of the examples will not be explained. ill link to places where you can learn it.

This course is about Basic JavaScript. 

I will only use a text editor (Notepad) and Google Chrome. But you can use other text editors or browsers.






```html
I am going to appear in the web page.

<script>
console.log("I am going to appear in the console");
</script>
```
