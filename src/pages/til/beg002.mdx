It's hard to see what JavaScript code is doing, so we use `console.log`.
`console.log` is an instruction that shows in the browser console what is put between the parentheses `()` like in the example.

It's like a **stethoscope for code**. A sthetoscope you can leave inside your patient.

```javascript
console.log("I'm going to appear in your browser's console!");
```
