You can put many instructions in a single line, but the instructions run like if they were in different lines.

This means if you call `console.log` in the same line, it will still show 2 lines of text.

It's better to use different lines to keep the code more readable.

```javascript
console.log("Line 1"); console.log("Line 2");
```
