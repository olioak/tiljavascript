A string in JavaScript is text. But because code is text too, when you _really_ need to write text in code, you use quotes. Like this: `"I am text"`.

Notice the double quotes to the left and right of the text. You can use double quotes or single quotes. The difference will be explained later.

```javascript
<script>
console.log("I was text all along!");
</script>
```
