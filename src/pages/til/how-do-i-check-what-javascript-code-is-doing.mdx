videoNotes:
  - break[ upper lower case, quotes, missing parens]

Because it's hard to see what JavaScript code is doing, we use `console.log`.
`console.log` is an instruction that shows in the console what is put between the parentheses `()`.

It's like a **stethoscope for code**. A sthetoscope you can leave inside your patient.

```javascript
console.log("I'm going to appear in your browser's console!");
```
